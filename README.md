SIP-based Alarm Serving (SAS) Gateway


In cooperation with Telekom Austria Group, we have developed the middleware application which is running on the OpenWRT-based smart home gateway and is serving all alarm system handling functions to detect and decode alarm events coming from all types of alarm systems. The decoded alarm messages and events are sent to any pre-defined client in form of a SIP message. Moreover, the actual status of the alarm system and serving gateway is regularly checked and notified.
